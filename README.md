To run the examples update the environment variables accordingly.

```
export API_KEY=<YOUR MONGO ATLAS DB API KEY>
export API_URL=<YOUR MONGO ATLAS DB API URL>
export DB_CLUSTER=<YOUR MONGO ATLAS CLUSTER NAME>
export DB_NAME=<YOUR MONGO ATLAS DB NAME>
export COLLECTION_NAME=<YOUR COLLECTION NAME>
```


Note that the structure and IDs in the examples will likely not work for your db without modification, but hopefully will give you a starting point for using this SDK.
